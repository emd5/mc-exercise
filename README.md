Merge conflict exercise with 201 project team


## John's Thoughts
This exercise should have a little more details.  Not to dumb it down to much but I think at a bootcamp level you need to basically break it down PER computer WHICH command.  This would resolve a lot of the re-reading of the storyline and messing up things numerous times.

## Luke's Thoughts
I agree with John that the instructions were a little confusing with wording. What I gleaned from the exercise is the importance of communication and following the predetermined order SOP.
